osxmidi4j
=========

Tutorial:
---------

Setup
-----

Put the jar file on your classpath
    Make sure that the folder is writable for the Java process as osxmidi4j will try to copy the librococoa.dylib to its folder and add it to the java.library.path.
    If the application doesn't have write access you need to add librococoa.dylib to the java.library.path manually

Usage Standard Java MIDI API
----------------------------

osxmidi4j will register itself automatically to the Java runtime as a MIDI device provider.
Call the standard Java MIDI API
All osxmidi4j devices will be prefixed with "CoreMidi - "

CoreMidi services API
---------------------

The interface net.sourceforge.osxmidi4j.midiservices.CoreMidiLibrary provides the Mac OS X CoreMidi services API for Java.
It is (partly) generated by JNAerator and relies heavily on the Rococoa library and JNA.
